<blockquote><b>Typically How I Work</b>: 1. My Initial reply to ask if the product is under warranty 2. I then collect as much information as possible on the make, model, issue. 3. I then work out a quote either there or on first meeting. Service Contract will be done using the Service Agreement template at Law Depot website. <b><i>more specifically...</i></b>1. Greet 2. ask to sit down and we'll look at the machine 3. make an estimate of cost, negotiate if necessary 4. show customer the website to make the service agreement and explain that a credit card android reader will be used for payment. 5. once work is agreed, do the work. 6. ask customer to look over the machine. 7. Collect Payment 8. away greeting. </blockquote>

I AM NO LONGER WORKING THROUGH THUMBTACK.COM<br /> BECAUSE THEY CHARGE FOR CREDITS TO SEND QUOTES<br />
WHICH WOULD PUT ME IN THE HOLE AS I WANT TO <br />PROVIDE INEXPENSIVE SERVICE TO MY CUSTOMERS.<br />
